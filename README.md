Cognifyz Machine Learning Internship

This repository contains machine learning and data analysis tasks completed as part of the
Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.
The work focuses on applying core machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing,
regression, classification, and exploratory data analysis using a real-world restaurant dataset.

Tasks Overview

Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction (Regression)
Predicted aggregate restaurant ratings using regression models
Performed data cleaning, encoding, and feature analysis
Evaluated performance using MSE and R² metrics

Task 3: Cuisine Classification (Classification)
Classified restaurants based on their primary cuisine
Addressed multi-label cuisine data and class imbalance
Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models

Task 4: Location-Based Restaurant Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed restaurant distribution using city, latitude, and longitude
Identified high-density restaurant regions
Studied relationships between price range, ratings, and location
Visualized insights using plots and charts
